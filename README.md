# CS50 Project: Zork Text Adventure Game

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my CS50 project repo. This is where I've been working on a classic text adventure game inspired by Zork. It’s a fun little project where you get to explore, interact, and solve puzzles all through the command line. If you’re into retro games or just curious about how text adventures work, you’re in the right place.

## Why This Exists

Honestly, this project exists mainly because I wanted to learn. CS50 is an amazing course, and building this game was a great way to practice what I’ve learned so far. It’s all about getting comfortable with Python, problem-solving, and using Git to keep track of everything. Plus, who doesn’t love a bit of nostalgia with a classic text adventure?

## What’s Inside

- The main game code for the Zork-inspired text adventure.
- Some helper scripts and files to run and test the game.
- Basic README (this one!) to explain what’s going on.

## How It’s Structured

- **/src**: This folder has all the Python scripts that make the game run.
- **/tests**: Contains some simple tests to check that parts of the game work as expected.
- **README.md**: Yep, this file — where I explain what this project is about.
- Other config files for Git and Python stuff.

## What I Hope to Achieve

By working on this project, I’m aiming to:

- Get better at writing clean, efficient Python code.
- Understand how to break down problems and build solutions step-by-step.
- Learn to use Git for version control and collaboration.
- Have fun creating something playable and maybe even share it with friends.

Thanks for stopping by! If you want to try the game or peek at the code, feel free to dive in. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
